A collaboration session workflow defines the systematic process for productive interactions between users and Claude through either Claude Code or Claude Desktop platforms. This workflow establishes profile methodology, enables systematic collaboration patterns, and maintains institutional memory across sessions.

## Guidelines

Collaboration sessions follow a structured progression that transforms Claude from generic AI assistance into specialized professional partnership. Both Claude Code and Claude Desktop platforms support this methodology through MCP server integration and profile activation.

### Session Initialization

Every collaboration session begins with automatic profile activation that establishes the systematic methodology and professional competencies:

> Active profile: **DEVELOPER** | Thursday, July 10, 2025, 4:59 PM EDT

This initialization confirms:

- **Memory system access** - Institutional knowledge and previous session continuity
- **Temporal awareness** - Current date, time, and timezone context
- **Profile methodology** - Systematic approach for the collaboration domain
- **Tool availability** - Filesystem, memory, thinking, and time capabilities

### Session Structure

Collaboration sessions maintain systematic workflow patterns:

1. **Profile acknowledgment** - Automatic methodology establishment
2. **Context establishment** - Previous work reference and current objectives
3. **Systematic execution** - Profile-specific approach to requested tasks
4. **Documentation integration** - Conversation logs and diary entries for continuity
5. **Session conclusion** - Summary and next steps for future sessions

## Best Practices

Optimize collaboration effectiveness through systematic session management and platform-specific approaches. These proven techniques enhance productivity and maintain consistent workflow quality across different collaboration contexts.

### Effective Session Management

- **Start with context** - Reference previous work and establish current objectives
- **Leverage profile methodology** - Allow the specialized approach to guide collaboration
- **Document significant sessions** - Create conversation logs for future reference
- **Maintain project continuity** - Use consistent file organization and clear next steps

### Platform Integration

- **Claude Code** - Ideal for development workflows with direct repository access
- **Claude Desktop** - Excellent for broader collaboration with file system integration
- **Memory system** - Essential for maintaining institutional knowledge across sessions
- **Profile consistency** - Ensures systematic approach across different interaction types
