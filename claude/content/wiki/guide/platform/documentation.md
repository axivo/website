## Guidelines

Documentation search capabilities help locate specific information, track collaboration patterns, and analyze project evolution through structured content organization and metadata tagging.

### Search Patterns

Users can search across conversation logs and diary entries using various criteria to locate specific information, track patterns over time, or analyze collaboration evolution:

- **Date-Based** - Search by specific dates, months, or years
- **Profile-Based** - Filter by collaboration profile (CREATIVE, DEVELOPER, ENGINEER, etc.)
- **Tag-Based** - Locate content using hyphenated tags (`#troubleshooting`, `#system-design`)
- **Entity Type** - Filter by documentation type (`diary` or `conversation`)
- **Content-Based** - Search within entity names and observation content
- **Combined** - Multi-criteria searches for sophisticated knowledge discovery
