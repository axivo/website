Foundational profiles provide shared collaboration patterns and platform capabilities that all specialized profiles inherit. These common profiles establish consistent methodologies and system integration across all collaboration domains.

## Overview

The platform includes two common profiles that serve as the foundation for all specialized profiles:

- **Collaboration** - Collaboration patterns and systematic methodologies
- **Infrastructure** - Platform capabilities, tool integration and execution protocols

These common profiles ensure consistent collaboration quality and system integration regardless of the selected specialized profile. All domain-specific profiles inherit from both **Collaboration** and **Infrastructure** profiles to maintain unified behavioral patterns while adding specialized competencies.
