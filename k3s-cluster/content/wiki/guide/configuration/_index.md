The configuration guides present in this section allow you to configure the K3s cluster, matching your hardware and software requirements.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Prior adjusting any settings, [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) the [`k3s-cluster`](https://{{< param variables.repository.cluster >}}) repository.

## OS Installation

Each cluster node must have Ubuntu Server `{{< param variables.os.version >}}+` LTS (64-bits) OS installed, which is a requirement for [Cilium](https://cilium.io). The required `apt` package dependencies changed also, compared to previous Ubuntu Server LTS release.

> [!TIP]
> Read the [OS Installation](/k3s-cluster/tutorials/handbook/server) tutorial, on bare-metal infrastructure.

## Ansible Vault

All sensitive data stored in this public repository (passwords, emails, etc.) is safely encrypted, using [Ansible Vault](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/cli/ansible-vault.html).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use the **same global password** for various encrypted settings, in your configuration files. See an [example](/k3s-cluster/tutorials/handbook/ansible/#encrypted-variables), to understand the logic behind.
